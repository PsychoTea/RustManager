# RustManager
RustManager is a tab-based RCON tool for Rust. It supports both new Rust's WebRCON interface, as well as Rust Legacy's Source RCON based communication.

It still lacks many features compared to other RCON tools, but it is a work in progress - here are some of the features I plan to add in the near future:
 - Players list
 - Bans list
 - Kick/ban players
 - Multiple tabs for chat and console
